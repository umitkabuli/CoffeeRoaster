2. Roast and Learn Together - Terms and Definitions 
(https://www.home-barista.com/home-roasting/roast-and-learn-together-terms-and-definitions-t28279.html)

1C - first crack. Often described as a sound similar to popping corn, where water is released.
2C - second crack. Often described as a sound similar to Rice Crispies, a physical fracturing of the cellular wall.
Aroma - using the nose to detect odors of the wet grounds/coffee
BT - Bean Mass Temperature as measured by a thermocouple or thermometer within the bean bed
C Roast - City Roast (1C complete)

C+ - City Plus Roast (1C complete and even roast developed)
Charge - both the size and time of insert of the greens
Conduction: Heat applied by direct contact
Convection: Heat applied by air
Cupping: Use of SCAA protocol to assess, determine, and note coffee quality: http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&d=cupping-protocols

DP - Dry Process coffee
Drop - the time the beans finish roasting for an external cool
Drying Phase/Stage: The first part of the roast where the beans are dried to the proper level.
Endothermic: Beans are absorbing heat energy
ET - Environmental Temperature (air temperature within roaster)

Evaluating - Preparing coffee in any preferred method and assessing the coffee quality
Exothermic: Beans releasing heat energy
FC - Full City Roast (on cusp of 2C)
FC+ - Full City Plus Roast (first few snaps of 2C)
Fragrance - The odor detected in the dry grounds of the coffee

MET - Maximum Environmental Temp (max exposure temp during roast)
Radiant: Heat applied by radiance off of a surface, heating element, infra red heat
Ramp Phase/Stage : The phase/stage after the drying up to 1st crack where the heat applied is generally increased. Maillard reactions are occurring and then sugars.
RoC-- Rate of Change of ET, positive or negative.

RoR-- Rate of Rise of BT degrees(C or F) rise/time(usually per minute)
Semi-washed processing Also known as "honey, pulp-natural, or semi-lavado." See: http://stumptowncoffee.com/processing/semi-washed/
TC4-- A Arduino based roast monitoring and controlling device developed by the homeroasting community
Thermocouple - temperature sensor for measurement and control
Turn point - moment at which the bean temp bottoms out before beginning to rise

Warming Phase: The initial phase of heat being applied to the beans.
WP-- Wet processed coffee
